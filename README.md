Print Agent Project

Description: Developed a comprehensive Node.js-based Print Agent system designed to manage and process print jobs efficiently. This project involved creating a backend application that acts as an intermediary between users submitting print jobs and printers executing them. The system features user authentication, job management, and document handling, with integration to cloud services.

Key Responsibilities:

    Designed and implemented a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js for handling print job submissions, user authentication, and job status tracking.
    Developed user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure access and manage user sessions.
    Managed print jobs with MongoDB, including job creation, status tracking, and database interactions using Mongoose.
    Integrated AWS S3 for scalable document storage, allowing secure upload and retrieval of print documents.
    Simulated print job processing with time delays to mimic real-world printing scenarios, enabling job queue management and status updates.
    Implemented file handling using Multer for direct file uploads and processing.

Technologies:

    Node.js, Express.js
    MongoDB, Mongoose
    AWS S3 (optional)
    JWT, Bcrypt
    Multer for file uploads
